# *Terrible* Job Request

```
My nephew is looking for a job. I've attached his resume in Word .DOC
format and generic cover letter. Please help him get a job.
```

I've actually seen this several times before. It's awful and puts the
recipient in a super awkward position. They're now supposed to both
research potential jobs and advocate for someone who they've never met
who is only weakly related to someone they do know? If the nephew
wants a job, the nephew should do some hustling and at least make it
clear what job he'd like. A variant of this that would be much easier
to digest would say "My nephew is looking to apply to [SPECIFIC JOB X,
link to job] and has background [X, link to resume] and is looking for
guidance on whether he's got the right kind of experience to get the
job and if it would be interesting."
