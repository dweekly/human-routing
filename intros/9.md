# Great Introduction

```
From: [INTRODUCER]
To: [PERSON A]
Cc: [PERSON B]
Subject: B, Meet A

A, I want you to meet B because [REASONS]; B is cc:'ed here, please
follow up with B directly.
```

```
From: [PERSON A]
To: [PERSON B]
Bcc: [INTRODUCER]
*Subject line unchanged*

Thanks, [INTRODUCER] (to bcc)

B, I'm delighted to meet you because [REASONS].

[DETAILED OUTREACH & PERSONALIZED REQUEST]
```

This sequence starts well with the Introducer making it clear that the
right next step is for A to email B. Since B knows INTRODUCER, this
email will be opened by B and B will now be "warm intro'ed" to A and
ready for A's email. A then immediately follows up and moves the
INTRODUCER to bcc, which simultaneously lets the INTRODUCER know that
the introduction was a success and that it's now in A's hands and
takes them off the thread to avoid filling their inbox. B will almost
certainly read and respond. Mission accomplished.
