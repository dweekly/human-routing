# *Great* Investor Pitch

```
Dear [PERSON]. It's been a while since [SHARED PERSONAL EVENT]. I see
that you've made some interesting investments in [COMPANY IN SAME
SPACE AS MINE] and I liked your blog post about [HOW THE SPACE MY
COMPANY IS IN IS AWESOME]. I'm not sure how closely you've followed
[MY COMPANY] but we're going to be raising our next round soon and
given your experience in the space I wanted to run it by you. We
already [IMPRESSIVE RECENT DEVELOPMENT]. Are you free next week for a
coffee? I've attached our latest deck and here's a link to the
demo/video that can let you poke at it a bit more.

This connects the dots between the investment thesis of the recipient
and the company. It has new details about the company's development,
communicates that a round is being raised, and includes ways to find
out more with a deck and demo. This also makes the email nicely
forwardable to the rest of the partnership or investment committee and
has a soft ask of "coffee" (meeting in person) to review.
