# Mediocre Introduction

```
From: [INTRODUCER]
To: [PERSON A], [PERSON B]
Subject: Interesting People

A, B: you're both great people and should chat.
```

This intro is hit or miss and might largely depend on what kind of
earlier discussions INTRODUCER has already had with both A and B prior
to sending this email. Critically - and this is a common failure mode
- neither A nor B is absolutely certain who should respond
first. While this sounds silly, I've seen this mean the thread get
dropped and the intro lost because both parties assumed the other had
some more urgent need or specific request and archived the thread,
expecting to hear from the other later.
