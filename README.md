# Human Routing Protocol

Getting your message in the right hands is hard, especially if you
don't have a broad professional network yet yourself. There are
approaches and patterns I've observed as highly effective and highly
ineffective and I figured if only there were some sort of handbook
that could help people understand how to route a query via a human
network, it would save a lot of people time and help them be much more
effective.

This GitHub repo is an experiment to help people understand
how better to route messages through networks of humans by
showcasing both good and bad ways to accomplish a goal.

Different subdirectories have different engagement types:
* "job" for people looking for jobs.
* "invest" for people looking for investment for their companies.
* "issue" for people needing help with a technical issue.
* "intros" for someone making an introduction to two others.

Part of why I've done this experiment as a GitHub repo is because I
would love to get pull requests to include new kinds of interaction
examples both good and bad.

Cheers,
