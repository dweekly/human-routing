# Terrible Issue Resolution

```
Hi, [PERSON I DON'T KNOW]. I see you once worked at [COMPANY]. We have
had an issue with our ad/app/content on [SERVICE] and are just looking
to have a quick phone chat with someone at [COMPANY] to get this
sorted out. [INSERT SOB STORY ABOUT HOW LIFE IS HARD, DESIGNED TO
EVOKE PITY AND NOT RELEVANT TO ISSUE] Can you tell me who to call?
```

I actually got this request this week and it's part of what motivated
this post. This is awful. It doesn't contain any specific information
about the issue, it has nothing forwardable, and the action the sender
is asking for is highly unreasonable: to have an ex-employee of a
company hand out contact information for an authoritative present
employee of the company based on absolutely no data or personal
connection.

For bonus points, when I didn't reply right away, the person wrote a
followup message that said "Ok. My instincts were right. I should not
have approached a complete stranger to ask for help. Lesson learned."
I kid you not. Good grief.
