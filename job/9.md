# *GREAT* Job Request

```
Hi, [PERSON]. It's been a while since [LAST MEANINGFUL INTERACTION
WITH PERSON]. I noticed you are currently working at [COMPANY] - I'd
love to hear more about what it's like working there and how it's been
for you. Along these lines, I wanted to let you know I've  applied for
[SPECIFIC JOB X, link to public job post] which really excited me
because [SPECIFIC REASONS TIED TO PERSONAL BACKGROUND & PROFESSIONAL
HISTORY]. I'd love your read on whether you think there's a fit there
and some color on what's happening with that part of the org. If you
do think I'm a fit from what you know of me, I'd naturally appreciate
the referral.
```

Why it's effective: it's specific and gets to the point. You are the
applicant, you've indicated exactly what job you're applying to and
why you liked it and are soliciting specific input and a potential
referral from someone who works there who you know. This will get a
response - it's personal and people love talking about their work
(both the good and the bad) so this person will likely enjoy engaging
with you on the topic if they like you and think you might be a good
coworker.
