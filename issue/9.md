# Excellent Issue Resolution

```
Hi, [PERSON]. Sorry to bug you but I've got an urgent issue at hand
that you may be able to help me resolve. My ad/app/content [INCLUDE
DETAILED LINKS/IDS] was suddenly removed from [SERVICE] on [SPECIFIC
DATE(S)] for [SPECIFIC REASONS, links to takedown codes, etc]. I sent
an appeal [LINK TO APPEAL TEXT] to support on [DATE] but the support
staff [SPECIFIC DESCRIPTION OF WHY APPEAL IS NECESSARY] and I need to
escalate this. After reviewing could you please see if you could
forward this to someone in the right department to help escalate?
Thanks!!
```

Here you've given someone you know something pretty straightforward to
do: A) assess with the data given whether you have a valid /
appealable issue and B) forward the message to the right person
internally if so. All the data a reviewer needs is already contained
in the message.
