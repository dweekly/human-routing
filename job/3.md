# *BAD* Job Request

```
Hey [PERSON], I'm looking for a job. Can you help find me a gig?
```

At least you know this person, but you haven't provided them with a
clear course of action unless they happen to have heard of a job that
is a perfect fit for your background (and that they are familiar
enough with your background to put two and two together). You're
putting the work on them to do the research when you're the one
looking for a job. Probably won't get a reply unless from a very good
friend and will reduce the odds that future messages to this person
will get a response.
